# Random Sitemap Navigator

Basic javascript web application that takes a given sitemap url and allows the user to store it in their local device cache. Upon clicking on the stored sitemap, it will navigate you to a random page listed on said sitemap. 
Very specific use case, I know. 

For the sake of a blog, you would use this to pull up a random blog post from a random date. Imagine playing Russian Roulette with your favorite podcast(s).
The application will store the list of sitemaps on your local browser for you for a one-click, random experience.
